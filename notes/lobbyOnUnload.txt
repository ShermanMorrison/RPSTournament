Goal: Remove user_id from users upon leaving lobby

onbeforeunload: Doesn't work if user decides to stay on page,
because it removes him on the post request without unloading

onunload: Doesn't work because get request happens before post request.
This can be fixed by adding a duplicate, briefly.

Refreshes page: Get adds him, post removes him. Net change = 0
Really leaves page: Post removes him. Net change = -1
