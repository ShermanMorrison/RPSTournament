A and B both have session['inGame'] == true

After submitting moves, A and B both get submittedMove messages
This disables the Submit button.

<Had considered session.pop('inGame',None) after both submit>
<This ended up causing redirects to lobby upon further submit posts,
which added duplicate users to the lobby>


A clicks "Return to Lobby" and sends a post request

A gets a returnToLobby message and is directed back to lobby.




__Situation__

A challenges B to Game

B clicks accept

Both A and B post joinGame messages


__Implementation__

Each client secure session has a set of games he is in, session['games']

When A posts a joinGame request, the server puts (gameID, role) into his session['games']
Server then sends A the joinGame message with the gameID.

A then calls window.location.assign(/game/gameID)
